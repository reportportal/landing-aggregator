```/twitter```

### Github aggregation details

```/github/contribution```

For example,

```json
{
  "commits": {

    "4": 201,
    "12": 1018
  },
  "unique_contributors": {
    "1": 20,
    "4": 52,
    "12": 80
  }

## Production deployment

Several instances of app should be deployed to provide fault-tolerance and distribute load.
There is [Traefik](traefik.io) which is reverse-proxy and load-balancer which does not require any
service registry and allows zero-conf discovery via Docker API.
Example can be found [here](docker-compose.yml)
